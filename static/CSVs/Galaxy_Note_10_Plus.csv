"Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus (Aura Black, 256 GB)",No Name,54999.0,5,Classy product,"Beast! Its been one and half month..Battery life is amazing.. Gaming runs very smooth and most importantly camera performance is marvellous and night mode is way better compared to others so far. Exynos 9825 might be inferior to snapdragon 855+ .. But in real life it doesnt matter, it is sure high quality performance. After 8 months battery life still on its best, Performance still beastly, the camera is on the same level with ONE UI 2.1."

"Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus (Aura Black, 256 GB)",No Name,54999.0,5,Perfect product!,"I actually made the switch from the iPhone XS Max to the Note 10+, and after getting around the learning curve, I am finding this phone much better for multiple reasons. 1.
